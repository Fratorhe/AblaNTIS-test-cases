BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR Exp-x-T-x TEST CASES (i.e., imposed surface temperature and recession)

Content description:

   * surface_recession.dat: Distance over time of the surface points from the center of the original hemispherical dome. The points are indicated as angular positions with 0 angle at the stagnation point and ~121Â° at the sample bottom.

   * surface_temperature.dat: Surface temperature over time for the same angular positions as in surface_recession.dat.

   * standard_deviation.dat: Standard deviation of the averaged data over time for the same angular positions as in surface_recession.dat.

   * pressure_distribution.dat: Pressure distribution over the surface for the same angular positions as in surface_recession.dat.

General notes
----------------------------------------

   * The boundary conditions were derived from the experimental measurements of surface temperature and recession of the corresponding AblaNTIS Plasmatron test.
